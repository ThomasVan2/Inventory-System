# Inventory-System
This GitHub repository contains a JavaFX application with a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing inventory.


## Description ##
This project is a JavaFX application with a graphical user interface (GUI) based on the provided “GUI Mock-Up”. The application provides functionalities to manage parts and products in an inventory system. The GUI consists of several screens, including the main screen, add part screen, modify part screen, add product screen, and modify product screen.

The main screen contains buttons for “Add”, “Modify”, “Delete”, “Search” for parts and products, and “Exit”, lists for parts and products, and text boxes for searching for parts and products. The add part screen, modify part screen, add product screen, and modify product screen are used to add, modify, or delete parts or products from the inventory.
